# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores and implements the gradient descent algorithm for optimizing the parameters of a univariate linear regression model. The goal is to find the best values for *`w`* and *`b`*  by minimizing the cost function using an iterative approach. This notebook is useful for those who want to understand how gradient descent works and how it can be applied to train a linear regression model.
### Features
- Introduction to gradient descent for linear regression
- Implementation of the cost function and its gradient
- Iterative optimization of parameters using gradient descent
- Visualization of gradient descent in action
- Use of NumPy for numerical computations
- Use of Matplotlib for data visualization
- Local plotting routines for enhanced visualization
