# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores and implements the gradient descent algorithm for optimizing the parameters of a univariate linear regression model. The goal is to find the best values for  and  by minimizing the cost function using an iterative approach. This notebook is useful for those who want to understand how gradient descent works and how it can be applied to train a linear regression model.
