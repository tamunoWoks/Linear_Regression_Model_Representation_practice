# Linear Regression Model Representation with One Variable
### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of a simple linear regression model using one variable. It demonstrates the mathematical representation of linear regression and applies it to a small dataset for illustrative purposes. The notebook is ideal for beginners who want to understand the fundamental concepts of linear regression and how to implement it using Python.
### Features
- Introduction to linear regression with a single variable
- Implementation of the hypothesis function: 
- Use of NumPy for numerical computations
- Use of Matplotlib for data visualization
- Training data representation and basic exploration
- Plotting data points to visualize the relationship between the variables
### Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib  

**You can install the required packages using:**
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```
### Dataset
The notebook uses a small dataset containing two data points:
|Size (1000 sqft)|Price (1000s of dollars)|
|----------------- |-----------------------|
|1.0|300.0|
|2.0|500.0|
### Notebook Structure
